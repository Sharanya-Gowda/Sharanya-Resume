        I am Sharanya M S, a passionate, dedicated, and enthusiastic student
        actively exploring the fields of machine learning, software development,
        and emerging technologies. My goal is to continuously improve my skills
        and contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact.

        I possess strong technical expertise in a range of programming
        languages, including Java, Python, C, C++, Flutter, and R. I also have
        proficiency in essential web technologies like HTML/CSS and Unix. My
        experience spans beyond programming languages to include data
        structures, algorithms, data analytics, and computer architecture. I am
        skilled in using GitHub and a variety of AI tools, which enable me to
        efficiently collaborate and manage complex projects.

      <p class="about-next">
        Currently, I am at an intermediate level in areas like data networking,
        Flutter, Matlab, and finite automata. I am also taking initial steps in
        machine learning and SQL, aiming to further expand my knowledge and
        practical expertise in these domains.

      <p class="about-next">
        My technical background is complemented by strong communication,
        presentation, and public speaking skills. I have a proven ability to
        work effectively in teams and build strong relationships with my peers,
        fostering a collaborative and positive environment. I believe in the
        power of teamwork to drive success in any project.

        I've had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience during my App
        Development Internship at M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology from
        October 2023 to November 2023, where I honed my technical and
        problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I’ve actively participated in
        competitive technical events such as Debug Derby, organized by IEEE, and
        the Python Showdown, a flagship event focused on data visualization by
        CSE RIT. These experiences have enriched my problem-solving abilities
        and exposed me to diverse technical challenges.

        Beyond my technical and academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for
        creative expression. I enjoy immersing myself in acting and theatrical
        performances, which has nurtured my confidence and presence in front of
        audiences. I love to venture out and discover new places, seeking
        inspiration from the world around me. My commitment to yoga allows me to
        embrace tranquility and balance in life, while Bharatanatyam, a
        classical Indian dance form, is my chosen medium to express creativity
        and emotion. With years of dedication, I’ve achieved a higher level of
        proficiency in Bharatanatyam, and it continues to be a significant part
        of my identity.

        As I move forward, I am looking for opportunities where I can apply my
        skills and enthusiasm in machine learning, software development, and
        cutting-edge technologies. I am excited about contributing to meaningful
        projects while continuously learning and growing.
